# chat-application
The Chat Application is a Python-based software system designed to enable real-time communication between users through text messages. This application allows multiple users to connect, send messages, and receive responses instantly, simulating the core functionality of modern messaging platforms. The project focuses on building a reliable and interactive communication system while demonstrating fundamental and intermediate programming concepts.

The application follows a client–server architecture, where the server is responsible for managing connections, handling message transmission, and ensuring that messages are delivered to the appropriate users. Each client connects to the server using a network socket and can send or receive messages in real time. This design helps users understand how real-world chat systems work behind the scenes.

The Chat Application uses Python’s networking and threading capabilities to handle multiple users simultaneously. By implementing concurrent connections, the system ensures that messages from different users are processed efficiently without delays. The program also includes proper input validation and message formatting to improve user experience and maintain communication clarity.
